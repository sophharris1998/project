            <p>After going through a challenging period in my life I decided to take some time to decide what I wanted to do next. I have always been fascinated by tech and how things work and when I moved into a flat with a web developer it gave me a massive opportunity to learn something new from someone already in a tech role. Starting to solve simple problems felt rewarding and the idea that there are so many options, routes and languages to learn was appealing to me.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In October 2022 I was selected to be part of the first cohort with Nology in partnership with The Prince‚Äôs Trust. This was a 15-week course that provided me with the preparation of skills and knowledge to get into the Web Development sector. I am someone who thrives in an environment that allows continued learning. I have high energy levels, and often past colleagues have stated that my positivity is passed onto others, this has been shown and needed in my previous career as an Activity Instructor. I have always wanted to get involved in tech and I am always curious about how things work but I have never had the opportunity until now. Since joining the Nology trainee course my understanding of Web Development and my confidence have increased dramatically and it has been inspiring to see mine and my classmate's progress.
